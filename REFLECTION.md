## What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?

- Through this assignment, I learned how to initialize and configure a local Git repository, stage and commit code changes, and synchronize those changes with a remote GitHub repository. The experience helped me understand how commits create a timeline of progress and how GitHub acts as a centralized platform for storing and managing code collaboratively.

## What was most confusing or frustrating?

- I would say the most confusing/frustrating thing would have to be the errors I was getting with my powershell to clone the repo , but I had forgotten that my exisiting github account already had a prior username so I was going in circles thinking my git instalation or wasnt succesfull. 

## Why do you think developers use Git?

- Developers use Git to keep track of code history, avoid losing work, and collaborate with others without messing up the main project. 

## How might this help with larger projects in the future?

- For larger projects, Git would be an essential tool to help maintain organization. It allows a teams to work simultaneously on different parts of a code without interfering with each otherâ€™s work. With proper commit practices and version control, the projects will remain maintainable and reversible, even as they grow in complexity or versions.
